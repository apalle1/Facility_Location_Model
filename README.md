# Facility_Location_Model

The pdf file shows how to formulate and solve the below facility location problems using Python linear optimization library PuLP:

1) Uncapacitated Fixed-charge Location Problem (UFLP)
2) Set Covering Location Problem (SCLP)
3) Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP)

One of the major strategic decisions faced by firms is the number and locations of factories, warehouses, retailers, or other physical facilities. This is the purview of a large class of models known as facility location problems. The key tradeoff in most facility location problems is between the facility cost and customer service. If we open a lot of facilities, we incur high facility costs (to build and maintain them), but we can provide good service since most customers are close to a facility. On the other hand, if we open
few facilities (Figure 8.1(b)), we reduce our facility costs but must travel farther to reach our customers (or they to reach us). Most (but not all) location problems make two related sets of decisions: (1) where to locate, and (2) which customers are assigned or allocated to which facilities. Therefore, facility location problems are also sometimes known as locationâ€“allocation problems.
